This is my first React App, it's supposed to be a "mini" e-store about cars

### Important

When I built this app I used a "light" custom css framework, turned out this framework looks good on desktop but it's not responsive at all. So the app ended up being not responsive. Next time I would use something like tailwind or pure css.
